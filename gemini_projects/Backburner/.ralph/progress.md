### Iteration 1 - Dropdown Collapse Fix
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Completed Criteria**: 1, 2, 3

Fixed the collapsible section toggle issue in web-server.ts:
- **Root cause**: Duplicate onclick handlers on both section header div and toggle span caused event bubbling. Clicking the toggle span fired both handlers, toggling twice and returning to original state.
- **Solution**: Removed onclick attribute from all toggle spans (lines 1964, 2099, 2160, 2210, 2253)
- **Debugging**: Added console logging to toggleSection() function using string concatenation (template literals not supported in inline HTML)
- **Verification**: Build passes successfully with `npm run build`
- **Commit**: aaef84f "ralph: Fix dropdown collapse by removing duplicate onclick handlers"
