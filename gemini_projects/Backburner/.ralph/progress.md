# Progress Log

> Updated by the agent after significant work.

## Summary

- Iterations completed: 5
- Current status: UI improvements - hyperlinks, settings modal, localStorage persistence

## How This Works

Progress is tracked in THIS FILE, not in LLM context.
When context is rotated (fresh agent), the new agent reads this file.
This is how Ralph maintains continuity across iterations.

## Session History

### Iteration 1 - Dropdown Collapse Fix
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Completed Criteria**: 1, 2, 3

Fixed the collapsible section toggle issue in web-server.ts:
- **Root cause**: Duplicate onclick handlers on both section header div and toggle span caused event bubbling. Clicking the toggle span fired both handlers, toggling twice and returning to original state.
- **Solution**: Removed onclick attribute from all toggle spans (lines 1964, 2099, 2160, 2210, 2253)
- **Debugging**: Added console logging to toggleSection() function using string concatenation (template literals not supported in inline HTML)
- **Verification**: Build passes successfully with `npm run build`
- **Commit**: aaef84f "ralph: Fix dropdown collapse by removing duplicate onclick handlers"

**Files modified**:
- src/web-server.ts (10 insertions, 5 deletions)

### Iteration 2 - Server Infrastructure Verification
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Completed Criteria**: 4, 5, 6, 7

Verified server infrastructure and enabled hot reload for development:
- **Criterion 4 (Server startup logging)**: Already implemented at web-server.ts:4270-4278. Server logs startup messages and URL when binding to port 3000.
- **Criterion 5 (Graceful shutdown)**: Already implemented at web-server.ts:4308-4333. Handles SIGINT, SIGTERM, uncaughtException, and unhandledRejection with proper cleanup via `saveAllPositions()`.
- **Criterion 6 (Hot reload)**: Updated package.json to use `tsx watch` for dev:web script (changed from `tsx src/web-server.ts` to `tsx watch src/web-server.ts`). This enables automatic file watching and server restart on changes.
- **Criterion 7 (Build passes)**: Verified `npm run build` completes successfully with no TypeScript errors.

**Files modified**:
- package.json (changed dev:web script to enable watch mode)

**Commits**:
- 69a3430 "ralph: Enable hot reload for dev:web and verify server infrastructure"

**Status**: ALL CRITERIA COMPLETE

### Iteration 3 - RSI Divergence & Cross-Strategy Signals
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Task**: Improve divergence detection and add cross-strategy signal matching

Implemented three major enhancements:

1. **Relaxed swing detection threshold**:
   - Changed swingLookback from 5 to 3 bars in detectDivergence function
   - This finds more swing points for divergence comparison
   - Files: src/indicators.ts, src/backburner-detector.ts

2. **Added divergence detection to Golden Pocket detector**:
   - Imported detectDivergence and calculateRSI to GP detector
   - Added divergence detection in both detectNewSetup() and updateExistingSetup()
   - Only includes divergences that align with setup direction (bullish for long, bearish for short)
   - Added Div column to GP table in web-server.ts
   - File: src/golden-pocket-detector.ts, src/web-server.ts

3. **Added cross-strategy signal indicators (X-Sig column)**:
   - Added getCrossStrategySignal() function to detect when same symbol has setups in both BB and GP
   - Shows 🎯✓ (green) when GP aligns with BB signal
   - Shows 🎯✗ (red) when GP conflicts with BB signal
   - Shows 🎯⚠ (yellow) when mixed signals exist
   - GP tab shows 🔥✓/🔥✗/🔥⚠ for BB signals
   - File: src/web-server.ts

**Files modified**:
- src/indicators.ts (1 line - default swingLookback changed)
- src/backburner-detector.ts (1 line - explicit swingLookback=3)
- src/golden-pocket-detector.ts (+50 lines - divergence detection)
- src/web-server.ts (+70 lines - Div column for GP, X-Sig columns for both tables)

**Commit**: 87cc0cd "feat: Add RSI divergence detection to GP + cross-strategy signals"

### Iteration 4 - Backtest Analysis & Timeframe Filtering
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Task**: Analyze trade data and implement filters to improve bot performance

**Problem Identified**: User noticed Backburner triggers seemed flawed, triggering contrarian setups against BTC's movements.

**Backtest Analysis** (312 closed trades across 4 days):
| Timeframe | Direction | Trades | Win Rate | PnL |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----|
| 1h LONG | 27 | **0%** | -$1,058 |
| 1h SHORT | 68 | **13%** | -$1,291 |
| 15m LONG | 69 | **57%** | +$6 |
| 15m SHORT | 57 | 47% | -$490 |
| 5m LONG | 66 | 38% | -$559 |
| 5m SHORT | 25 | 32% | -$410 |

**Key Findings**:
1. **1h timeframe is catastrophic** - 0% win rate for longs, 13% for shorts, 100% stopped out
2. **15m LONG is the only profitable combo** - 57% win rate with actual TP hits
3. **No TP hits on 1h** - all 95 trades exited via stop loss
4. **5m trades suffer from contrarian entries** against BTC trend

**Solution Implemented**:
Added `shouldTradeSetup()` filter function at web-server.ts:38-62:
1. **Disable 1h timeframe entirely** - Only allow `['5m', '15m']`
2. **Add BTC trend filter for 5m**:
   - Skip long setups when BTC is bearish (short/strong_short)
   - Skip short setups when BTC is bullish (long/strong_long)
3. Applied filter to both `handleNewSetup()` and `handleSetupUpdated()` functions
4. Existing positions still get updated (so they can close properly)

**Files modified**:
- src/web-server.ts (~40 lines - filter function + handler modifications)

**Build**: Passes successfully

### Iteration 5 - UI Improvements: Hyperlinks, Settings, Persistence
**Date**: 2026-01-13
**Task**: Multiple UI improvements requested by user

**Changes Implemented**:

1. **Hyperlinks in Backburner tab**:
   - Added `getMexcUrl()` function to Backburner table (renderSetupsTable)
   - Symbol column now links to MEXC (same as GP tab already had)

2. **Changed default link destination to Trading Bots**:
   - Default URL format: `https://www.mexc.com/futures/trading-bots/grid/SYMBOL_USDT`
   - Previously was: `https://www.mexc.com/futures/SYMBOL_USDT`
   - Created unified `getMexcUrl()` function that respects settings

3. **Settings modal**:
   - Added ⚙️ button in header next to ? (guide) button
   - Settings modal with radio buttons to toggle link destination:
     - 🤖 Trading Bots (default) - opens grid bot page
     - 📊 Futures Trading - opens futures trading page
   - Also shows saved list count and clear button

4. **Persisted saved lists with localStorage**:
   - `savedList` Set now persists to `backburner_savedList` in localStorage
   - `appSettings` object persists to `backburner_settings` in localStorage
   - `loadPersistedData()` restores both on page load
   - `persistSavedList()` called when items added/removed
   - `persistSettings()` called when settings changed
   - Lists survive page refreshes, rebuilds, and server restarts

**Files modified**:
- src/web-server.ts:
  - +50 lines for localStorage persistence functions
  - +45 lines for settings modal HTML
  - +50 lines for settings JS functions (openSettings, closeSettings, updateLinkSetting, clearSavedList)
  - Modified renderSetupsTable, renderGoldenPocketTable, renderSavedListTable to use getMexcUrl()

**Build**: Passes successfully
