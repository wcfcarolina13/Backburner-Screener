2. BTC directional/trend bots lost $969.49 combined
   - BTC bias-based trading underperformed today
   - Market conditions may not favor trend-following

2. WATCH: BTC Momentum, Trend Override - significant losses, may need parameter tuning
3. TEST: BTC Bias bots (new) - not yet activated, restart servers to enable
4. CONSIDER: Reducing position size on trend-following bots during choppy markets
